        Hi, I'm Burke J. Jaeger!
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:dimgray">
        I am a software engineer from New Jersey and I will be based out of Palo Alto and Hanover this year. I am passionate about the automotive world and have previously worked in web development and testing at BMW Group for projects with the BMW, Rolls Royce, and MINI vehicle brands. I am an incoming SWE intern at VMWare and will be working in Network Security at the Palo Alto office.
